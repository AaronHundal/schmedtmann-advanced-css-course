# Section 4 Notes

## SASS

<details>
<summary>What Is Sass?</summary>

- SASS is a CSS preprocessor, an extension of CSS that adds power and elegance to the basic language.
- We use SASS to fix the problems we have with CSS. CSS gets very messy very quickly, if you have a big css file in a big project, it becomes unmanageable.

<summary>What Does Sass Give Us?</summary>

- Variables: allows us to have variables so we can reuse colours, font-sizes, spacing, etc.
- Nesting: to nest selectors inside others, allowing us to write less code.
- Operators: for mathematical operations inside CSS.
- Partials and imports: allows us to write CSS in different files and import all of them into one single file.
- Mixins: to write reusable pieces of CSS code.
- Functions: similar to mixins, except they produce a value which can then be used.
- Extends: Makes different selectors inherit declarations that are common to all of them.
- Control Directives: for writing complex code using conditionals and loops (not covered in this course).

- [This codepen](https://codepen.io/aaronh053/pen/JjaqgZr?editors=1100) goes through a view examples of how variables, nesting, operators, mixins and functions are used in Sass.
- SCSS is the syntax of Sass used.
- On the codepen you can see what the compiled CSS looks like via the menu.
