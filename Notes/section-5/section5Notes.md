# Section 5 Notes

## Basic Responsive Design Principles

<details>
<summary>Fluid Layouts</summary>

- Fluid layouts adapt to the current viewport width (or even height).
- This means calculating in terms of percentages of viewport rather than px.
- And using max-widths instead of just widths.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Responsive Units</summary>

- Use rems instead of px to make it scalable.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Flexible and Fluid Images</summary>

- By default images dont scale, we need to fix that.
- Use percentages for image dimensions.
</details>

<details>
<summary>Media Queries</summary>

- Allow devs to create different versions of the webpage for different sizes of viewports (by using breakpoints).
</details>

<details>
<summary>Layout Types (float/flexbox/grid)</summary>

- All are fully supported in major browsers.
- Float layouts involve placing a bunch of boxes side by side using the "float" property. This is a pretty old tactic.
- Flexbox and grid are more modern.
- Flexbox is perfect for creating 1 dimensional layouts (rows and columns).
- Grid is perfect for 2d layouts.
